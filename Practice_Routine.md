# Practice Routines

This is very much a work in progress - the idea is to create a sequence of routines that can be worked through over a few weeks, a month or whatever time span allows me to hit all of the goals I currently have.

At this time, these are [here](README.md#Self Assessment)

## 30 minute Sessions

For now, I am working on shorter, 30 minute sessions. The aim is to rebuild strength and endurance in my arms, hands and the mental fortitude that practice requires (This may sound over the top, but it is very important!). Currently I plan to focus two 15 minute sections on some of the core skills and fundamentals I will need in order to meet the self assesment goals of getting back to being an 'intermidiate' guitar player. The list of exercises and resources here will need to be revised and retuned with effective reflection over the next few weeks. I am to mimick an Agile sprint in that I will reflect on what has gone well/not so well in the next two weeks, that date being set as 23/05/2021 for now.

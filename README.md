# H1 Guitar Practice

## H2 What is this?

This Repo is a place where I itend to record my guitar practice sessions, reflect on what went well and not so well and where I might need to improve. It's also a place where I will keep a record of useful lessons, exercises, songs, chords, scales and other practice resources. I want this to be a 'living' document so I will be evolving it over time.

It's very unlikely that this will ever be of any use to anyone other than myself, and other than giving me a place to play with markdown and git, it has basically nothing to do with code whatsoever.

## H2 Self Assessment

Currently (As of 11/05/2021) I am significantly further back than I have ever been with my guitar - I *would* have considered myself an intermidiate player around 10-15 years ago. Based on the criteria/core abilities found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAlB-71Jq4A&t=449s)

That gives me a target of:

- 8 Fundamental chords cleanly - G,C,D,A,E,Dm,Am,Em
- Change chords smoothly, on the beat
- Power Chords, up and down the fret board
- Bar Chords - Major and Minor, up and down the fret board (1-5-6-4 progression)
- Notes on Strings memorised (low E and A string)
- Solid understading of strumming patterns, clean playing of strumming patterns
- Timing (70 bpm quarter notes, 8ths notes, 16ths and back)
- Ear training - major or minor chords, finding the key
- Basic understanding of Music Theory
- Play a few simple songs
- Know how to play a few scales - Blues, minor pentatonic, major pentatonic, major and minor
- Picking - alternating picking a scale, bending, sliding, hammer ons and hammer offs
- Reading music (optional really)

Some of these will be easily achievable, some not so much.

## H2 Goals

My goal is to take a month or so (May) to self assess and revisit this list, build some good exercises and resources to make practice flow better and eventually replace YouTube videos with self recordings of exercises.
